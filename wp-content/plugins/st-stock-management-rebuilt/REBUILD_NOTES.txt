ST Stock Management - Rebuilt
----------------------------
This rebuilt package reorganizes the original plugin into a modern structure:
- st-stock-management.php (bootstrap)
- includes/ (classes: core, db, activator, deactivator)
- admin/ (original admin pages copied)
- public/ (original public files copied)
- assets/, languages/, templates/

Important:
- I preserved original admin/public PHP files (copied into admin/ and public/) so functionality remains intact.
- I added a proper core class and DB class to ensure activation and loading succeed.
- Some table definitions in the DB class were intentionally simplified; the important tables used by the plugin are included.
- If you want a full deep-refactor (convert admin pages to OOP classes, move templates), tell me and I will continue.

Install:
- Upload the entire folder 'st-stock-management-rebuilt' into wp-content/plugins/
- Activate the plugin in WP admin.
